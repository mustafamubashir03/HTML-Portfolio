    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a passionate learner of Computer Science with an artistic view. I usually spend my leisure time doing digital art and coding. Both of these skills have helped me become a creative and critical thinker. I also have a very holistic view of Computer Science and consider it more as a tool to solve digital problems than to think of it as a theoritical field of study. These days I am spending time exploring and learning technical skills along with learning computer science concepts in a practical way. Feel free to connect with me if you feel that our vibes might match.</p>
